All of the following Blue glaze recipes and more can now be found on my new open-source ceramics recipes website, Glazy: [https://glazy.org/search?base\_type=460&type=750&cone=high](https://glazy.org/search?base_type=460&type=750&cone=high)

The following tests were fired in two Jingdezhen public kilns at approximately cone 12 and in my own kiln at cone 10.  I just wanted to get a general idea of the blue glazes listed in High Fire Glazes.  

### Market Blue

Custer Feldspar 50, Whiting 4, Kaolin 24, Dolomite 22, Cobalt Carbonate 0.5

### Dark Water Blue

This recipe calls for 2% additional Iron Chromate, which I don’t have.  I tried this glaze without the Iron Chromate, as well as substituting Iron Chromate for a combination of Red Iron Oxide and Chrome Oxide.  I don’t know what this glaze is supposed to look like..

### Blue 4

This recipe calls for 13% additional Ultrox, which I don’t have.  I tried substituting with Zircopax, the result is kind of strange.
