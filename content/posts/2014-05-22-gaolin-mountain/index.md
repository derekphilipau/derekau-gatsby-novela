The traditional source of Kaolin clay used in Chinese porcelain is Gaoling mountain.  There’s actually not much to see at the park there- all the kaolin clay was mined out a very long time ago.  But the mountain itself is beautiful, and the nearby villages still offer a glimpse into “old China”.

Although there's not much to see related to ceramic history, the mountain is beautiful.
