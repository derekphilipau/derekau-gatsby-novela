Newly-published book and recipes from Harlan House!

Earlier this year, the pioneering ceramicist Harlan House published "My Work, My Way: Fifty Years in the Studio". Part autobiography, part studio guide, Harlan's lovely stories are interspersed with technical tips, special techniques, and recipes he developed over decades.  Harlan is generously offering his book as a free download, and he has allowed me to publish his recipes on Glazy.  Thanks so much, Harlan!
