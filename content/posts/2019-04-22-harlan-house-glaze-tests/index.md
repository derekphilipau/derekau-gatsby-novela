Absolutely beautiful results from tests of Harlan House's recipes.

Pictured here are tests of Harlan's Jun, March Crackle, HH Shino and HH Celadon.  Both March Crackle and HH Celadon have lovely satin surfaces, while the Jun is one of the best I've seen, falling neatly in the same high-silica "Jun" region as the ancient Chinese originals. All tests fired to Orton cone 10 in reduction atmosphere starting at cone 010.
