The side of a public kiln in the Sculpture Factory.

For quick drying, unfired porcelain clay sculptures are placed on top of the kiln while plaster molds are placed on the bottom.

On the side of the kiln are written various people’s mobile numbers, many of which are advertisements for services.  For instance, a craftsperson named 占 can help you spray glaze (吹釉, literally meaning “blow glaze“).
