These are melt tests of different types of porcelain stone from sometime at or before the Qing dynasty. Iron or blue _qinghua_ underglaze was used to write place names and other notes on each test.

Porcelain stone is an amazing material that primarily comes from a number of mines near Jingdezhen. Combining porcelain stone with kaolin results in beautiful high-fire porcelain bodies, while combining porcelain stone with a flux like "glaze ash" or whiting gives a beautiful celadon glaze in reduction.

For more information, see one of my favorite books on Chinese glazes (and ceramics in general): [Nigel Wood's "Chinese Glazes"](https://books.google.com/books/about/Chinese_Glazes.html?id=0VCoPwAACAAJ).
