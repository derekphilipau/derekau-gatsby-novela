Yu was a scholar of calligraphy and is regarded as one China’s modern masters. His works in cursive and semi-cursive manner are intensely animated. He is perhaps best known for his calligraphy and published related works on the topic. Because his later years were spent in [Taiwan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan), his writing style is very popular and his works are considered very desirable by collectors. Yu completed numerous inkworks, stone carvings, and title plaques while living in [Taipei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei) including works for the [National Museum of History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_History), [Din Tai Fung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Din_Tai_Fung), [Xingtiang Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsing_Tian_Kong), and the [Shilin Official Residence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilin_Official_Residence).
