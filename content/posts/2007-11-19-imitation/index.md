Craftspeople in Jingdezhen often work from photographs and illustrations.  Here it appears as if a nice large vase was spotted in a Jingdezhen shop and is now being copied in another studio.  Throughout history, Chinese ceramics has been based on an interplay of imitation and innovation.  In modern Jingdezhen imitations are the norm, unfortunately the level of craftsmanship rarely matches that of the ancient originals.
