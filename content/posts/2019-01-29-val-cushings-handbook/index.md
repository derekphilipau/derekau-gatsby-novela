Repost from [@alfredceramics](https://www.instagram.com/alfredceramics/).  Leave it to the amazing people at [@alfredceramics](https://www.instagram.com/alfredceramics/)to turn test tiles into freaking ART!  These are the most beautiful test tile photos I've ever seen.  [@earlyamericanrobotpottery](https://www.instagram.com/earlyamericanrobotpottery/)blew my mind: "We're using these glazes on our artwork, so why not photograph the tests the same way we photograph our ceramics?" The completed sets of cone 6 and cone 10 glazes from Val Cushing's Handbook represent hundreds of hours of work by Keith Simpson and Rachel Allstadt [@luxmud](https://www.instagram.com/luxmud/) and are an example for all of us to emulate.  Download the PDF's and check out the images in full resolution.
