I've finally gotten a new low-fire electric kiln. This kiln is designed to fire up to 1000Â°C, so it's useful only for on-glaze enamels and bisque. Total cost was 2900RMB, which is about $420USD.

    The kiln uses 45cm X 50cm shelves, a common size here.

    Elements are also snaked through the bottom of the kiln, on top of which are placed bricks.
