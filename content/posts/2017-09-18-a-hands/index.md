From the[_Tiangong Kaiwu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_Kaiwu) (天工開物) encyclopedia compiled by [Song Yingxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Yingxing) (宋应星) at the end of the Ming Dynasty comes the oft-cited quote:

“共计一杯工力，过手七十二，方可成器”

_"For the total work required to make a single cup, it must pass through 72 hands, and only then can it become a vessel."_

[_72 Hands_](http://72hands.org/) is an effort to document all types of ceramics techniques.  The video style is very simple- a single take of each technique focusing on the artisan's hands.  Each video is accompanied by an article with a description of the technique and photos.  Videos are shot in high-resolution 4K Ultra-HD resolution which gives a clear view of the technique.

Being based in Jingdezhen, I am first focusing my efforts on documenting porcelain production here.  But if there is sufficient interest in & support of the project I would like to document other pottery centers in China and abroad.
