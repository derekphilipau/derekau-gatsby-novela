The history of ceramic slip decoration reaches far back into antiquity.  Much as ancient pottery emulated more valuable vessels in precious metals, white slips were often applied to darker clay bodies in an effort to increase “value”.  Many inventive uses for slips have evolved through the centuries, such as Cizhou black and white slip carving, Chinese “cut-glaze” slip with resist patterns, Korean slip inlay and reverse inlay patterns, and the dramatic _hakeme_ brushed slips of Japan.

Similar to _hakeme,_ the _Painted_ series uses brushes to apply slip.  But _Painted_ removes the “ground” of the underlying thrown form, leaving behind only the slip.  Thus the decoration determines the shape of the vessel—the form is _painted_.
