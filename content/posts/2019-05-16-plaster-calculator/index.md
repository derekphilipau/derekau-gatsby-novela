The calculations are from USG ([https://www.usg.com/](https://www.usg.com/)), [Keith Simpson (Alfred University)](http://www.alfredceramics.com/simpson.html), and Andrew Martin (["The Essential Guide to Mold Making & Slip Casting"](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Essential_Guide_to_Mold_Making_Slip.html?id=X-rtBGDCBb0C)).Â
