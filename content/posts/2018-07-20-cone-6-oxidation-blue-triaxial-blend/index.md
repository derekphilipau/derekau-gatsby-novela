In [Chinese Glazes](https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC), we learn from Nigel Woods that the cobalt used for underglaze blue & white underglazes and blue glazes came in a range of chemical compositions and grades of purity.  Thus, there are many shades of blue due to the quality of cobalt-containing stone as well the overlying glaze.

In the same book, Nigel presents a lovely [Chinese blue stoneware glaze](https://glazy.org/recipes/2928) which, in addition to cobalt, contains iron and manganese "impurities".

In fact I'm personally not fond at all of glazes and underglazes containing _only_ cobalt as a coloring oxide.  Pure cobalt often comes out as a garishly blue color.  In the triaxial blend below, I take a nice clear glaze ([Sue's Clear](https://glazy.org/recipes/10997)) with added 1% Cobalt Carbonate.  Then I blend with 1.5% Red Iron Oxide (bottom left) and 1.5% Manganese Dioxide (bottom right).  The resulting colors on the bottom row are much more pleasing to my eye.
