Saying goodbye to the Alfred University Raw Materials Lab.  
I've been incredibly lucky to have spent a year at [@alfredceramics](https://www.instagram.com/alfredceramics/) with [@ceramicmaterialsworkshop](https://www.instagram.com/ceramicmaterialsworkshop/), [@kelleherceramics](https://www.instagram.com/kelleherceramics/), [@earlyamericanrobotpottery](https://www.instagram.com/earlyamericanrobotpottery/), [@corybrownceramics](https://www.instagram.com/corybrownceramics/) and so many other amazing teachers and students.  Thanks for this opportunity!
