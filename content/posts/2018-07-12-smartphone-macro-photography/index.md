I've tried a number of smartphone lenses in the article [Smartphone Microscopy](http://www.derekau.net/2016/03/27/iphone-microscopy/).

Today I received my first macro lens for smartphones, the [Xenvo iPhone Camera Lens Kit Pro - Macro Lens & Wide Angle Lens with LED Light](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A6D2JVI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

The lens was a bit expensive ($35), but opening the package I was surprised at the weight and feel of quality materials and real glass.  I've only taken a few photos so far but the image quality seems pretty good.

I'm still not sure how I'll incorporate macro photos of glazes into my documentation.  So far I'm pretty happy with how the macro photos reveal glaze details not visible in normal photos, but still show the character of the glaze (as opposed to microscopic images).

Here are some images of [Katz-Burke Matte with 5% Rutile 5% Mason 6600](https://glazy.org/recipes/20670).

Just to test, here is an example from the Xenvo Wide Angle Lens. It's a bit blurry on the edges.
