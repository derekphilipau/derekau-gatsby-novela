Creating a small Si:Al biaxial test to "fine-tune" a recipe, in this case Reitz Purple.  
Using the Glazy calculator, four "corner" recipes were created.  Volumetric blending using a syringe was used to create the intermediary glazes.  Tests fired to Orton Cone 10 in both oxidation and reduction.  For more information, see: https://glazy.org/u/derekau?collection=11075
