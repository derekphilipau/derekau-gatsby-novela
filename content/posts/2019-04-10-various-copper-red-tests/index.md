Various new tests of Copper Red glazes and variations now available on https://glazy.org

All glazes fired to orton cone 10 in reduction starting at cone 010 with oxidation hold at peak temp. Special thanks to [@pete.pinnell](https://www.instagram.com/pete.pinnell/)for his Copper Red firing tips (found in the Clayart archives).
