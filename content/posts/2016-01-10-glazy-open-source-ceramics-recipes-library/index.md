I invite all of you to join [Glazy](http://glazy.org/), a ceramics recipe library that allows anyone to browse and add pottery recipes for free.

Glazy was built using the latest open source tools, including [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).  The database of ceramic recipes was originally seeded with data from Linda Arbuckle’s [GlazeChem database](http://lindaarbuckle.com/arbuckle_handouts.html) and John Sankey’s [glaze database](http://www.johnsankey.ca/glazedata.html). John Britt, Alisa Liskin Clausen, Terry Rorison and Tara Hagen have also included their glaze tests with images.

Since it’s release, many new features have been added to Glazy, including improved charts and color search.  More information can be found on the [Glazy help page](http://glazy.org/help).

If you have ceramics recipes that you would like to add, or if you would like to help organize the recipes already in the database, please [contact us](http://glazy.org/contact).

[Glazy](http://glazy.org/) is constantly improving and evolving.  I hope you will join us!
