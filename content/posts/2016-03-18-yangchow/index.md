These are some of my great-aunt’s photos of Yangchow camp.

She notes the duration of internment as starting on 13 March 1943 and lasting until 6 October 1945.  She was housed in Yangchow Camp “C”.

An interesting history of the camp can be found on Frank Waller’s website at [http://www.haikufrank.co.uk/memories\_of\_yangchow.html](http://www.haikufrank.co.uk/memories_of_yangchow.html)

Some of these photos and more can be found on the [Australian War Memorial website](https://www.awm.gov.au/search/all/?query=yangchow&op=Search&submit=&relatedFilter=related_events&filter%255Btype%255D=Photograph&section%255B0%255D=collections&format=list&section%5B0%5D=collections&filter%5Btype%5D=Photograph).

Captioned "End of War" in my great-aunt's photo album. Relief supplies parachuted into Yangchow camp at the end of World War II. In the background is Yangchow's city wall. Frank Waller's article suggests these drops began around mid-September of 1945.
