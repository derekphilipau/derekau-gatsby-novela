Ceramics is not an independent craft, it has evolved in a complex environment of discourse with other craft traditions.  In Chinese ceramics this condition is reflected in the prevalence of skeuomorphisms, with ceramic vessels emulating the forms and manufacturing artifacts of more “valuable” metalworking traditions including bronze, silver and gold.

From Sotheby's 2008 Auction Masterpieces of Chinese Precious Metalwork, Early Gold and Silver; Early Chinese White, Green and Black Wares

The_ Planeware_ series is an exploration of the relationship between metalworking and ceramics.  Unlike traditional ceramics that emulate the _appearance_ of metalwork, _Planeware_ adopts the techniques and tools of metalsmithing to construct vessels with slabs of porcelain clay that have similar working characteristics to sheet metal.  Rather than “borrowing value” from precious metals crafts, _Planeware_ is instead influenced by the humble trade of the tinsmith.
