My work is featured in Rosette Gault's new book on paperclay.  I should note that only some of my work uses porcelain with small additions of paper.  Porosity is a big issue when making functional ware, and additions of paper can cause all kinds of problems.  In the past I tested cone 6 stoneware bodies with paper and various glazes but none were acceptable for functional use.   Even at higher cone 10-13 temperatures you will see noticeable differences in fired weight and porosity.  In the future I hope to write an article on these issues, but for now you can [buy the book on Amazon.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paperclay-Art-Practice-New-Ceramics/dp/140813120X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355825269&sr=8-1)
