With the data stored in [Glazy](http://glazy.org/) it is possible to visualize recipes using graphs and charts.

In the future, these visualizations and more will be added to Glazy at [http://glazy.org/graphs](http://glazy.org/graphs)

Below are simple pie charts showing the most commonly used glaze materials for both Mid-Fire and High-Fire glazes.

For those who are just starting out with glazes, these charts could be a useful guide when stocking glaze materials.

The charts on the left are for “base” materials, the materials that form the actual glaze.  On the right are charted the “additional” materials- typically colorants and opacifiers- that are added to the base glaze materials.

_There are still some strange and untrustworthy recipes in the Glazy database that may have skewed the results somewhat._

#### Mid-Fire Glazes
