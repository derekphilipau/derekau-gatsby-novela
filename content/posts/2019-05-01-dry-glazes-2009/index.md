I've just added some glaze tests from ["Dry Glazes" by Jeremy Jernegan, 2009](https://books.google.com/books/about/Dry_Glazes.html?id=HmuKnb_iR2AC).

Some interesting decorative textures and effects, although a number of the glazes were overfired at cone 10.  I’ve added even the “bad” tests, though, so that others can double-check their own tests or even avoid those recipes entirely.
