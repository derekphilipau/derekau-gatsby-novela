A specialized cart, _banche_ (板车), with its load of porcelain clay.  The sack tied to the cart’s undercarriage typically contains moving blankets for transporting fragile ware, plastic tarps to protect against rain, and straps for tying down loads.

Porcelain production in Jingdezhen would immediately halt without the tireless efforts of the carriers who transport materials and ceramics through every stage of the production process.
