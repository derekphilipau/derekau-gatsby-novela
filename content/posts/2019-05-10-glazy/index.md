Much like the open-source movement, our ceramics culture is largely one of sharing and collaboration.  Via mailing lists, discussion groups, and personal websites, potters freely share their knowledge.  Being largely self-taught, these resources have been extremely important to me.

In particular, ceramics recipes are handed down from one generation of ceramicists to another, much as one might teach grandma's secret chocolate-chip cookie recipe to a daughter or son.  However, ceramics recipes "don't travel well"- they are extremely sensitive to changes in materials, mixing, application, and firing.  

[_Glazy's_](https://glazy.org/) mission is three-fold:  To collect, archive and trace a lineage for historical & new ceramics recipes, provide a single framework to understand and compare differences in glaze chemistry, and to establish an open-source codebase for ceramic recipes calculation and storage.

_Collection and archiving_ of recipes is an on-going effort.  The original database was seeded with data from Linda Arbuckle's [GlazeChem database](http://lindaarbuckle.com/arbuckle_handouts.html), John Sankey's [glaze database](http://www.johnsankey.ca/glazedata.html), and Louis Katz's [Hyperglaze database](http://falcon.tamucc.edu/~lkatz/allglazes.txt).  Since then, many other sources have been included, as well as contributions from users.

As a tool for _understanding and comparing_ glaze chemistry, much more work needs to be done.  The development of these tools in _Glazy_ is the result of numerous discussions with ceramicists from all over the world.  Notably, the primary use of Stull charts is due to Matthew Katz's continuing research and [classes](http://www.ceramicmaterialsworkshop.com/).

As _niche_ software, glaze calculation software has often been written by a single developer.  Once that developer retires or loses interest, the software is abandoned.  During the Winter of 2017 I completely re-wrote the _Glazy_ website and published the entire project as open-source on [Github](https://github.com/).  This allows other developers to contribute, improve and sustain the _Glazy_ code, hopefully eliminating the "single developer" problem.  The _Glazy_ project actually exists as a family of open-source repositories all available on my [Github](https://github.com/) page:  [https://github.com/derekphilipau](https://github.com/derekphilipau)
