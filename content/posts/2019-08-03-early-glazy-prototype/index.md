Look familiar?Â Â No, it's not Glazy, it's Jingdezhen ðŸ˜œÂ   

Just a few samples from the glaze shops in Jingdezhen.Â Â You can get spoiled being a ceramicist here, where amazing glazes from every dynasty in every color are available by the bucket!Â Â Someday maybe Glazy will become a virtual Jingdezhen glaze shop!
