Happy New Year!  Wondering how to mix up a glaze of Living Coral, Pantone's official color of 2019?  Use the Glazy color search!

The top result is [@tom\_demeranville](https://www.instagram.com/tom_demeranville/)'s variation of Val's Ice Cream Matte with 8% red stain.  Shinos are also a close match!
