For 2017 I have refined all aspects of the “Painted” series, from the designs and brushwork to final glazing and firing.

In the following “Lobed” series, the form emerges through application of a chaotic brushstroke.

I’m personally enamored with the floral lobed forms and delicate brushwork in the following dishes.  2017 was also the first year that I began to make glazes that rivaled or even surpassed Jingdezhen celadons.
