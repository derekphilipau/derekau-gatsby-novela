(Disclaimer: I'm not a clay body expert!) Rather than a biaxial with changing glaze chemistry applied to a single clay body, here is the opposite:  A biaxial with fixed glaze (Nigel Wood's Jun) and variable stoneware clay body, with increasing Alumina moving up and increasing Silica to the right.  This test demonstrates that crazing is a function of the thermal expansion of both clay body and glaze.  If you can't get a glaze to fit you may want to change the body, instead, although adjusting the body may lead to other issues like dunting.
