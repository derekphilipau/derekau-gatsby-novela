From the [_**Tiangong Kaiwu**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_Kaiwu) (天工開物) encyclopedia compiled by [Song Yingxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Yingxing) (宋应星) at the end of the Ming Dynasty comes the oft-cited quote:

“共计一杯工力，过手七十二，方可成器”

_For the total work required to make a single cup, it must pass through 72 hands, and only then can it become a vessel._

_**72 Hands**_ is an effort to document all types of ceramics techniques.  The video style is very simple- a single take of each technique focusing on the artisan's hands.  Each video is accompanied by an article with a description of the technique and photos.  Videos are shot in high-resolution 4K Ultra-HD resolution which gives a clear view of the technique.
