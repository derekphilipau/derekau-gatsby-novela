From January to March of 2018 I had the opportunity to work at the [Northern Clay Center](https://www.northernclaycenter.org)Â as a McKnight Visiting Artist as well as participate with some of my pottery heroes in the wonderfully-curated "Expatriate Ceramics" exhibition. NCC is a well-oiled machine with an amazing staff. The care and attention they bring to supporting each artist and installing each exhibition is incredible. I feel extremely honored to have had the chance to be a resident artist at NCC, and I still miss the friends I made there as well as the wonderful city of Minneapolis. The exhibition of last year's McKnight artists has just opened at NCC, and once again it seems they've set up an amazing show. Unfortunately I cannot attend as I am still in Jingdezhen. Regardless, thanks so much for everything! (Photo by Soojin Choi)
