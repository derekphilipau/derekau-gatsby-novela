Sculptures being dried in the Jingdezhen Sculpture Factory.  In the top photograph, plaster molds used to build the sculptures can be seen lying on the ground.  A single sculpture may require the use of dozens of plaster molds.  The sculpture in the bottom right image has already been sprayed with glaze and is ready for firing.
