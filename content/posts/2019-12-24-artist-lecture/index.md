I'm honoured to be giving a lecture and workshop at the University of Applied Arts Vienna in January.   

Preparing this lecture has given me time to reflect on the past and imagine what the future of ceramics might be.  What does the "science fiction" future of ceramics look like?  I'd love to hear your thoughts..
