Repairing the rim of a large porcelain pot.  The damaged area is first wetted, and then successive layers of porcelain slip are brushed on.  The hair-blower dries the slip in order to prevent cracking.

Below this you can see the line from where the thrown upper and bottom halves of this pot have been joined.
