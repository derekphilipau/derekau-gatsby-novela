the glaze is difficult to apply given the large amount of Kaolin in the recipe. \\xA0A few months ago I fired about 20 pieces with Pinnell celadon with beautiful results except that the glaze crawled on every single pot. \\xA0I still haven\\u2019t determined if the problem was due to a) glaze application (sprayed inside, dried, then sprayed outside), b) ball milling the glaze for too long (3 1/2 hours), or c) too much shrinkage of the glaze due to the kaolin (using\\xA0New Zealand Halloysite).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And although no-kaolin recipes like Tichane\\u2019s 532.1 and Craig
