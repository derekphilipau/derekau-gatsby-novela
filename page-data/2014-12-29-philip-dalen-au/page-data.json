Tokuriki was born in Kyoto, where he has always worked. The last of a long line of traditional-style painters, he turned early to woodblock prints and became a leader of the Kyoto \\u2018Sosaku Hanga\\u2019. He graduated from the Kyoto City School of Fine Arts and Crafts and then from the Kyoto City Specialist School of Painting in 1924. In 1928 he studied \\u2018Nihonga\\u2019 painting under Tsuchida Bakusen (1887-1936) and Yamamoto Shunkyo (1871-1933) and exhibited with Kokuga Sosaku Kyokai, but about the same time in 1929 he changed to woodblock printing under the influence of Hiratsuka Un\\u2019ichi and began to contribute to the early print magazine \\u2018Han\\u2019. He was a member of Nihon Hanga Kyokai from 1932, and active in promoting \\u2018Sosaku Hanga\\u2019 in Kyoto. He was a co-founder of the Kyoto magazine \\u2018Taishu hanga\\u2019 in 1932, which helped create the sense of a local school of the Creative Print Movement much encouraged by Hiratsuka. He produced many sets of prints before and during the Pacific War based on traditional subjects, such as \\u2018Shin Kyoto fukei\\u2019 (\\u2018New View of Kyoto\\u2019, 1933-4), which also included designs by Asada Benji (q.v.) and Asano Takeji (b.1900), and \\u2018Tokyo hakkei\\u2019 (\\u2018Eight Views of Tokyo\\u2019, 1942). Most of these were published by Uchida of Kyoto, but after the war Tokuriki set up his own publishing company called Matsukyu, which also began to teach block-carving to artisans and artists, in later years many of them foreigners. In 1948 he also set up a sub-company called Koryokusha consisting of artists who would produce their prints under the financial umbrella of Matsukyu. Later sets include \\u2018Hanga Kyoto hyakkei\\u2019 (\\u2018One Hundred Print Views of Kyoto\\u2019, 1975). Tokuriki has continued to be active in teaching and writing, producing a long series of articles on print techniques in \\u2018Hanga geijutsu\\u2019 magazine during the 1970s.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_630.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_628_629.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u4E00\\u6708 January\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Ise Ujihashi Bridge\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_604_605.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u4E8C\\u6708 February\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Kasuga Shrine in Nara\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_618_619.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u4E09\\u6708\\xA0March\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Kagoshima Shiroyama\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_608_609.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u56DB\\u6708\\xA0April\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Mount Fuji in Clouds\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_620_621.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u4E94\\u6708 May\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Niju-Bashi Bridge\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_624_625.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u516D\\u6708\\xA0June\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Nikko Toshogu Shrine\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_622_623.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u4E03\\u6708 July\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Tago Bay\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_616_617.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u516B\\u6708 August\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Suwa Kintaikyo Bridge\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_626_627.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u4E5D\\u6708 September\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Ohmi Katata Ukimido Temple\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_610_611.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u5341\\u6708 October\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Fuji from Akinono\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_606_607.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"\\u5341\\u4E00\\u6708 November\"), mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Kasagiyama\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"./images/max_scan_614_615.jpg\",\n    \"alt\": null\n  }))), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u5341\\u4E8C\\u6708 December\", mdx(\"br\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }), \"\\n\", \"Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","hero":{"full":{},"regular":{},"narrow":{},"seo":{}}},{"id":"2af8f709-b954-50a5-b2a7-9179bfc0d0ad","slug":"/Yu-Youren","secret":false,"title":"于右任 Yu Youren","author":"Derek Au","date":"December 27th, 2014","dateForSEO":"2014-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Yu was a scholar of calligraphy and is regarded as one China’s modern masters.
